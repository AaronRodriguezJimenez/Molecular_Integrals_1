# Molecular_Integrals_1
Code from the "Molecular Integrals" Project

This code follows the "Student-Friendly Guide to Molecular Integrals" paper of: Kevin V. Murphy*, Justin M. Turney, and Henry F. Schaefer III (J. Chem. Educ. 2018, 95, 9, 1572â€“1578). A complete derivation of the molecular integrals involved in the Hartree-Fock (HF) procedure is provided. 
This code allow restricted HF calculations for first- and second-row atoms within the STO-3G basis in python3. 
The proper calculation of S, T, V, and G matrices is performed and used to compute the electronic energy for a molecular system. 
The STO-3G basis set was taken from: https://www.basissetexchange.org/
